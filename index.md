## Currently

Doing internship research with iVis-at-Bilkent organization.


## Interests

Language Parsers, Bytecode Interpreters, Compilers, Functional Programming, Mobile Development, Virtual Machines, desktop GUI development

## Education

`2017-2021`
__Bilkent University__
- __Computer Science__
- __Full Scholarship__

`2006-2016`
__Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi__

Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi is a special foundation by the Turkey government which focuses on education of gifted students. In early years students start with general concepts like scientific learning then they assigned to more specialized areas like physics or math.

## Experiences

`June 2020 - Not Finished`
__Research and Internship at iVis__
- [Incremental Packing Research (Not finished yet)]()
  - Packing of disconnected graphs is an important topic in various areas. There are very efficient algorithms in terms of fullness but these algorithms ignore the initial layout of the graphs. We are trying to come up with a feasible packing algorithm that works incrementally so that user preserves their mental map
- [Cytoscape Layout Utilities https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-layout-utilities](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-layout-utilities)
  - Formerly, the packing algorithm of this extension was centering to the point (0, 0).
  - Added the ability to pack the components according to the old center.
  - Fixed some bugs in the code such as converting decimal to integer
  - For my contributions you can check [PR #19](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-layout-utilities/pull/19)
- [Cytoscape Context Menus https://github.com/onsah/cytoscape.js-context-menus](https://github.com/onsah/cytoscape.js-context-menus)
  - Removed jQuery dependency by replacing functionality of jQuery with DOM api or implementing the similar functions by hand
  - Added recursive submenu feature. Formerly the extension only had top level menu and no submenu. I added nested submenus so that any menu item can have submenus.
  - Configured project with webpack and babel to develop using modern js but deploy in more compatible js version for browsers. Learned about modern js tools such as bundlers

`16/07/2019-15/08/2019`
__Internship at FNSS Savunma Sistemleri A.Ş.__
- Line based diff utility (<a href="">TermDiff</a>)
    - Implemented a diff utility similar to git but specialized it for a particular output format.
    - __Implemented Myer's algorithm from scratch__
    - Achieved linear time complexity by using Myer's algorithm
    - __Software is currently being used at FNSS__
    - Followed a mix between Object Oriented and Functional programming design principals while developing
    - Added inline diffs on top of line diffs 
    - Implemented a simple and useful web UI using plain Javascript and Html

`Fall 2019`
__Teaching Interpreters__
- Teached how to implement interpreters from scratch for 5 weeks
    - Teached BNF and EBNF notation
    - Teached how to write a recursive descent parser without a parser library
    - Implemented a simple language for educational purposes
    - Source code of the course is [here: https://github.com/onsah/Interpreter](https://github.com/onsah/Interpreter)

`Spring 2019`
__Tutor Assistant on CS115 labs__
- Helped students to complete their lab assignments by teaching basic programming principles
    - Studied python language
    - Teached basic programming concepts

`2018 Summer`
__Internship at PEKS Automation A.Ş.__
- Implemented geolocation algorithm
- Contributed the development of an embedded GUI program.

## Projects & Contributions

`2019 Summer`
<a href="https://github.com/onsah/Flux_rs/">__Flux programming language__: https://github.com/onsah/Flux_rs/</a> 
- __Fully featured scripting language implementation__
- Bytecode interpreted
- __Completely written from scratch without using external libraries for parsing, compiling, etc.__
- __Handwritten recursive descent parser__

`July 2019`
<a href="https://github.com/GNOME/gjs">__Contribution to GJS:__ https://github.com/GNOME/gjs</a>
- Gjs is a javascript runtime used for Gnome Desktop Environment
- Added unit tests which increased code coverage

<a href="https://github.com/hannesschulze/conecto">__Conecto:__ https://github.com/hannesschulze/conecto</a>
- Added clipboard sync functionality which allows user to copy from phone and paste from pc and vice versa.
- Used Gtk UI library and Vala programming language
- You can check my contributions at [PR #11](https://github.com/hannesschulze/conecto/pull/11)

`May 2019`
<a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/943">__Contribution to RustPython standard library__: https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/pull/943</a>
- Learned insights about interpreters
- Implemented some python standard library functions as native functions

## Awards and successes

`2016`
__Placed 156th among 1.5 million student in Turkey University Entrance Exam (Ygs)__

`2015`
Science Project competition, Honor award, Genius Olympiads, Oswego, USA
