## Currently

Making reserach with iVis-at-Bilkent organization.


## Interests

Language Parsers, Bytecode Interpreters, Compilers, Mobile Development, Linux Window Managers, Virtual Machines, GUI development

## Education

`2017-2021`
__Bilkent University__
- __Computer Science__
- __Full Scholarship__

`2006-2016`
__Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi__

Bilim ve Sanat Merkezi is a special foundation by the Turkey goverment which focuses on education of gifted students. In early years students start with general concepts like scientific learning then they assigned to more specialized areas like physics or math.

## Experiences

`June-August 2020`
__Research and Internship at iVis__
- [Cytoscape Layout Utilites https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-layout-utilities](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-layout-utilities)
  - Formerly, the packing algorithm of this extension was centering to the point (0, 0).
  - I added the ability pack the components according to the old center.
  - Also I fixed some bugs in the code
  - For my contributions you can check [PR #19](https://github.com/iVis-at-Bilkent/cytoscape.js-layout-utilities/pull/19)
- [Cytoscape Context Menus https://github.com/onsah/cytoscape.js-context-menus](https://github.com/onsah/cytoscape.js-context-menus)
  - Removed jQuery dependency by replacing functionality of jQuery with DOM api or implementing the similar functions by hand
  - Added recursive submenu feature. Formerly the extension only had top level menu and no submenu. I added nested submenus so that any menu item can have submenus.
  - Configured project with webpack and babel to develop in modern js but deploy in more compatible js version for browsers. Learned about modern js tools such as bundlers

    - Achieved linear time complexity by using Myer's algorithm
    - __Software is currently being used at FNSS__
    - Followed a mix between Object Oriented and Functional programming design principals while developing
    - Added inline diffs on top of line diffs 
    - Implemented a simple and useful web UI using plain Javascript and Html

`Fall 2019`
